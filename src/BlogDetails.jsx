          Title: Handling the "Cannot destructure property 'basename' of
          'React2.useContext(...)' as it is null" Error in React
        </h3>
        <div>
          Introduction: When working with React applications, it's not uncommon
          to encounter errors while using hooks like useContext. One such error
          is the "Cannot destructure property 'basename' of
          'React2.useContext(...)' as it is null" error. This error typically
          occurs when attempting to destructure a property from the result of
          the useContext hook, but the value being destructured is null. In this
          blog post, we will explore the possible causes of this error and
          discuss how to resolve it effectively. I. Understanding the Error: The
          error message indicates that the 'basename' property cannot be
          destructured from the result of the useContext hook because it is
          null. To troubleshoot and fix this error, we need to examine the
          context initialization, usage, and potential null values. II. Causes
          of the Error: Uninitialized or Incorrect Context Provider: Check if
          the context provider is properly initialized and available in the
          component tree. Ensure that the context provider is providing the
          expected values, including the 'basename' property. Incorrect Context
          Usage: Verify that you are correctly importing the context object and
          using the useContext hook. Double-check that the useContext hook is
          called with the correct context object. Make sure the context object
          contains the 'basename' property.
